Oemof stands for "Open Energy System Modelling Framework" and provides a free, open source and clearly documented model to analyse energy supply systems. It is developed in Python and designed as a framework with a modular structure containing several packages which communicate through well defined interfaces.

With oemof we provide base packages for energy system modelling and optimisation.
