v0.0.5 (March 25, 2016)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features
############

* added flexible transformer with two inputs and one output
  (`issue #116 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof_base/issues/116>`_)
* You now have the option create special groups of entities in your energy
  system. The feature is not yet fully implemented, but simple use cases are
  usable already. (`Issue #60 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof_base/issues/60>`_)

Documentation
#############

* The documentation of demandlib's `electrical_demand` class has been cleaned up.
* The API documentation now has its own section so it doesn't clutter up the main
  navigation sidebar so much anymore.

Testing
#######

* There's now a dedicated module/suite testing solph constraints.
* This suite now has proper fixtures (i.e. `setup`/`teardown` methods) making
  them (hopefully) independent of the order in which they are run
  (which, previously, they where not).

Bug fixes
#########

* using platform independent expression to define the basic path
  (`issue #122 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof_base/issues/122>`_)
* Weeks no longer have more than seven days.
  (`Issue #126 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof_base/issues/126>`_)


Other changes
#############

* Simplified API of demandlib
