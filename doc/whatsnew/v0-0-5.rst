Testing
#######

* There's now a dedicated module/suite testing solph constraints.
* This suite now has proper fixtures (i.e. `setup`/`teardown` methods) making
  them (hopefully) independent of the order in which they are run
  (which, previously, they where not).

Bug fixes
#########

* using platform independent expression to define the basic path
  (`issue #122 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof_base/issues/122>`_)
