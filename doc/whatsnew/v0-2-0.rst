API changes
###########

* Rename `NodesFromCSV` function to `nodes_from_csv`
* Replace LinearTransformer and LinearN1Transformer classes with one Transformer class. The new class has n inputs and n outputs. Please note that the definition of the conversion factors has changed. See the new docstring to avoid errors (`Issue #351 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof/issues/351>`_).


New features
############

* Add new outputlib module to analyse and and plot optimization results.
  All decision variables of a Node are now collected automatically which
  enables an easier development of custom components within the oemof logic.
  See examples for usage!
* A new component `GenericCHP` allows an accurate modelling of different CHP
  types including combined-cycle plant.
