 Developer Notes
=========================================

Here we gather important notes for the developing of oemof and elements within
the framework.


Collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use the collaboration features from Github, see https://github.com/oemof.


Git branching model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far we adhere to the git branching model by Vincent Driessen, see
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/.


Issue-Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Section about workflow for issues is still missing (when to assign an issue with
what kind of tracker to whom etc.).
